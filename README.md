# GymSync-ConsoleEdition

Small project in C++ made to present a "Food Tracker"/logger for everything you eat. Made in my free time. 
Mostly still a work in progress, however, first part is already done.

## Features...

A really sick starting up screen. I got inspired to do this after using metasploit.

An whole string array consisting of handwritten quotes to motivate your gym tracking!

ps, if you can't read the string
```cpp
    std::string Quotes[] = { "Works without the need of a connection!", "Greetings From Amsterdam!", "Hit that new PR Today!", "one more scoop of pre-workout sire", "windows-only. mac? linux? only NT Technology.", "Made with Love", "Never Gonna Give You Up!", "tell everyon' bout us", "What are we listening today? Metal? Rap? Girly Music? Tiktok Songs? Voicemessages from a ex?", "Did you take enough protein today?", "Eat a banana once in a while!", "WinterArc Has Started..", "Did you know that this is an array?", "i just killed my ex... i still love him THOUGH? - SZA", "Quality over Quanity! (with your reps ofcourse)", "Now without MicroTransactions!", "sending ad statics data to google...../s", "GYMRATS ASSEMBLE!", "Don't Skip Legday!", "Track all those damn calories!", "50 Notifications from your phone warning that your headphones are too loud..." };
```

The food will display in your food diary!


### **Aren't you convinced yet? Try GymSync (work in progress) NOW!** only compile it for your computer because I actually don't really want to give you the build, I'm just evil like that.

sorry mac and linux users :( no build for you

ps: this all was made satire, if someone is ever looking through my repositories, this readme is a joke, don't take it too serious haha, take care!
